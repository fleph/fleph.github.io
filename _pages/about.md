Welcome to my homepage!
I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Cityu-Oxford joint Centre for Intelligent Multidimensional Data Analysis(CIMDA), Hong Kong.
My advisor is <a style='color: black;' href='https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/hong-yan(e4dbdba0-cead-46cb-b7e2-ed86fd3cec9b).html'>Hong Yan</a>. 
Before joining CIMDA, I earned my Ph.D. from Fudan University, School of Mathematical Sciences in 2024 under the guidance of <a style='color: black;' href='https://math.fudan.edu.cn/fa/56/c30607a326230/page.htm'>Yimin Wei</a>.
My academic journey began at Fudan University, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degrees in Information and Computational Mathematics and Data Science in 2017.
